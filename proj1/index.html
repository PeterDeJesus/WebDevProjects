	<p>In 1535, Jacques Cartier arrived in the area of what is now known as Montr&eacute;al.</p>
	<p>An Indian village called Hochelaga occupied the area at the bottom of
		the mountain. At the highest point of the mountain, Jacques Cartier named it
		Mount Royal.</p>
	<p>In 1642, the first colony was established by Paul de Chomedey.</p>
	<p>The French settlers and the Native Iroquois struggled to coexists and fighting
		between two sides took place until a treaty was settled in 1701.</p>
	<p>As a result of the French and Indian War, Montr&eacute;al surrendered to the british
		forces in 1760.</p>
	<p>In 1832, Montr&eacute;al officially became a city. It is the second largest French
		speaking city in the world; only second to Paris.</p>
	<p>From 1841 to 1849, Montr&eacute;al was the capital of Canada.</p>
	<p>By mid 19th century, Montr&eacute;al lead Canada's manufacturing industry producing
		consumer goods.</p>
