	<p>Established in 1950, Bertha's Deluxe Chocolates started from Bertha's home 
	   in California. The chocolates and sweets are a long time family recipes that 
	   were once made every year dating back from Bertha's Great-Grandmother for their 
	   yearly family gatherings. </p>
	<br>
	<p>We opened our store for the first time in 1950 located at La Jolla, California 
	   and still going strong, continuing to serve San Diegans and visitors from around 
	   the world. </p>
